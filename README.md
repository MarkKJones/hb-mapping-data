HB mapping data
--------------

A variety of mapping data was taken for HB by Eric SUn, Steve Lassiter 
and Mike Fowler.

A Lakeshore probe Lakeshore-XHGT-9060-55937-Q1 was used for the measurements.
The manual is Lakeshore-XHGT-9060-55937-Q1.pdf .
The probe correction table is given in the manual and
the data from the table has been put in file: Lakeshore-probe.dat

The hall probe could be moved along the central axis in fixed steps.
They were sixty step points. The central point (step # 27) was 
at X=-1.746cm, Y = -3.670cm and Z= -3.413cm 
relative to the magnet center ( need to clarify if it is mechanical center?)
The Z position for each point is given in the spreadsheets.

A set of measurements were taken at the central point (#27) for
a series of positive currents. The results are in HB-central field.xls
and the data extracted in file: HB-central-B-I.dat

Data was taken for positive currents with the current ramped up
and the down and measurements taken at step #27. Data was taken
for  negative  currents with the current ramped up
and the down and measurements taken at step #27.
The results are in hysteresis curve 2-26-16 Pos-Neg.xlsx
The data was extracted for the positive current ramp up: pos-up-current.dat
The data was extracted for the positive current ramp down: pos-down-current.dat
The data was extracted for the negative current ramp up: neg-up-current.dat
The data was extracted for the negative current ramp down: neg-down-current.dat
While taking this data , there was a quench during a second ramp up with negative current.
